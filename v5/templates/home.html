    <p>
        Time series data are ubiquitous in various real-world applications, ranging from finance to healthcare. 
        Traditional methods such as ARIMA and LSTM have shown effectiveness in domain-specific tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language tasks 
        including Q&A, translation, and standardized tests (e.g., SAT, GRE).
    </p>
    <p>
        Since time series and language data share similar sequential structures, this project explores the potential of 
        applying LLMs to time series analysis. Our goal is to benchmark and evaluate the performance of LLMs in this exciting domain.
